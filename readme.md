# &beta;etamax [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cowboygneox/betamax.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cowboygneox/betamax)

Betamax is a tool for mocking external HTTP resources such as web services and REST APIs in your tests. The project was inspired by the [VCR][vcr] library for Ruby.

[The official Betamax](https://github.com/robfletcher/betamax) seems to have gone into disrepair, so the rival is in-progress.

Documentation will follow soon. Please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/cowboygneox/betamax/issues) if there is something you'd like to see.
