Betamax is a tool for mocking external HTTP resources in your tests. The project was inspired by the [VCR](https://relishapp.com/vcr/vcr/docs) library for Ruby.

We've been more or less offline for 3 years, and we're reviving the project. Feel free to reach out to us with questions or concerns.

Documentation will follow soon. Please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/betamaxteam/betamax/issues) if there is something you'd like to see.
