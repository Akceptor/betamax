Betamax is a tool for mocking external HTTP resources in your tests. The project was inspired by the [VCR](https://relishapp.com/vcr/vcr/docs) library for Ruby.

[The official Betamax](https://github.com/robfletcher/betamax) seems to have gone into disrepair, so the revival is in-progress. Please see the [2.0 milestone](https://github.com/betamaxteam/betamax/milestones) for information.

Documentation will follow soon. Please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/betamaxteam/betamax/issues) if there is something you'd like to see.

While things are getting back in gear, feel free to reach out to us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/betamaxteam/betamax).
